# Cascade — Deploy from Scratch

Full server setup: Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04 + AmneziaWG kernel module + Docker + Caddy reverse proxy.

---

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| OS | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or Ubuntu 24.04 LTS |
| Kernel | 6.1+ (see Step 1) |
| RAM | 512 MB minimum |
| Access | Root |
| Network | Public IP, ports 443/TCP and WireGuard UDP ports open |

---

## Step 1 — Upgrade kernel to 6.x (Ubuntu 22.04 only)

> **Ubuntu 24.04:** skip this step — ships with kernel 6.8 by default.

Ubuntu 22.04 ships with kernel 5.15. The AmneziaWG DKMS module requires ≥ 6.1
(`timer_delete` symbol). Install the HWE kernel:

```bash
apt update && apt install -y linux-generic-hwe-22.04
reboot
```

After reboot verify:

```bash
uname -r
# expected: 6.8.x-xx-generic
```

---

## Step 2 — Install AmneziaWG kernel module

```bash
add-apt-repository ppa:amnezia/ppa
apt install -y amneziawg
```

Load the module immediately and register it for autoload on boot:

```bash
modprobe amneziawg
echo "amneziawg" | tee /etc/modules-load.d/amneziawg.conf
```

Verify:

```bash
lsmod | grep amneziawg
# expected: amneziawg   131072  0
```

---

## Step 3 — Install Docker

Use Docker's signed APT repository as described in the official
[Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository) or
[Debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/#install-using-the-repository) instructions.
The artifact installer configures this repository automatically and verifies the Docker signing-key fingerprint.

---

## Step 4 — Configure kernel parameters

Enable IP forwarding and tune network buffers (required for WireGuard routing and HTTP/3):

```bash
cat > /etc/sysctl.d/99-cascade.conf << 'EOF'
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 1
net.core.rmem_max = 7340032
net.core.wmem_max = 7340032
EOF

sysctl --system
```

---

## Step 5 — Clone repository

Minimal/stripped-down VPS images often don't ship `git` — install it first
if the clone below fails with "command not found":

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y git
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexnikon/cascade.git
cd cascade
```

---

## Step 6 — Pull Cascade image

The Docker image is built by GitHub Actions on every merge to `master` and published
to GitHub Container Registry. No local build required:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml pull
```

> **Local development only:** to use a locally-built image, run `./scripts/build.sh`
> and add `-f docker-compose.override.yml.example` to your Compose commands.

---

## Step 7 — Configure Cascade

Edit `docker-compose.yml`. The key variables:

```yaml
environment:
  - WG_HOST=1.2.3.4         # public IP or domain (can also be set in Settings UI)
  - PORT=8888               # Web UI port (listens on localhost only)
  - BIND_ADDR=127.0.0.1     # bind to localhost — Caddy proxies from outside
```

On first visit, the web UI shows a **Create First User** form. Create the admin
account there; after creation, the form disappears and login is required.

---

## Step 8 — Start Cascade

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Verify it is healthy and listening on localhost:

```bash
docker ps
curl http://127.0.0.1:8888/api/health
# expected: {"host":"...","status":"ok","version":"3.0.0-alpha"}
```

---

## Step 9 — Obtain TLS certificate (acme.sh)

Cascade must be running (Step 8) before this step.
acme.sh uses standalone mode — it temporarily binds port 80 to complete the ACME HTTP-01 challenge.
**Port 80 must be free** (Caddy is not started yet at this point).

Install the pinned and checksum-verified acme.sh release through the bundled helper:

```bash
sudo ./deploy/caddy/scripts/acme-install.sh YOUR_PUBLIC_IP YOUR@EMAIL.COM
```

### Option A — bare IP address (most common for VPS)

Let's Encrypt supports TLS certificates for bare IP addresses, but **only** via the
`shortlived` profile (6-day validity). Standard 90-day certificates for IPs are not
available from Let's Encrypt. Without `--certificate-profile shortlived` you will get:
```
Error creating new order :: Default profile does not permit IP address identifiers.
```

```bash
~/.acme.sh/acme.sh --issue \
  --server letsencrypt \
  -d YOUR.SERVER.IP \
  --standalone \
  --certificate-profile shortlived
```

acme.sh installs a cron job that renews automatically every 3 days — no manual action needed.

#### Testing with Let's Encrypt Staging CA

Before going live, use the [LE staging environment](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/)
to avoid hitting rate limits. Staging issues **untrusted** certificates — browsers will show a warning,
but the full ACME flow is validated.

```bash
~/.acme.sh/acme.sh --issue \
  --server letsencrypt_test \
  -d YOUR.SERVER.IP \
  --standalone \
  --certificate-profile shortlived
```

> `--certificate-profile shortlived` is required for bare IPs on **both** staging and production.
> Without it the order is rejected regardless of which CA is used.

Via `setup.sh`:
```bash
bash deploy/setup.sh --staging          # interactive
bash deploy/setup.sh --yes --staging    # non-interactive
```

When you are ready for production, set `ACME_STAGING=0` in `deploy/.env` and re-run `setup.sh` —
it will detect the staging cert, delete it, and issue a trusted production certificate.

### Option B — domain name

If you have a domain pointing to the server, use a standard 90-day certificate instead:

```bash
~/.acme.sh/acme.sh --issue \
  --server letsencrypt \
  -d yourdomain.example.com \
  --standalone
```

No `--certificate-profile` flag needed. Auto-renewal every 60 days.

Install the certificate to a persistent location:

```bash
mkdir -p /etc/ssl/cascade

~/.acme.sh/acme.sh --install-cert -d YOUR.SERVER.IP \
  --key-file       /etc/ssl/cascade/server.key \
  --fullchain-file /etc/ssl/cascade/server.crt \
  --reloadcmd      "docker exec cascade-caddy caddy reload --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile 2>/dev/null || true"
```

---

## Step 10 — Deploy Caddy reverse proxy

Caddy sits in front of Cascade: serves the decoy site on HTTPS, and only routes
requests under a secret path to the admin UI.

```bash
cd ~/cascade/deploy/caddy
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```bash
# Secret path prefix for the admin UI — choose something random, no slashes
ADMIN_PATH=your_random_secret_here

# Cascade port (must match PORT in docker-compose.yml)
CASCADE_PORT=8888
```

Start Caddy:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f
```

Expected output — no errors, then:
```
{"level":"info","msg":"serving initial configuration"}
```

---

## Step 11 — Verify full stack

```bash
# Decoy site (no admin path)
curl -k https://YOUR.SERVER.IP
# → StreamVault HTML

# Admin UI (with secret path — note the trailing slash)
curl -k https://YOUR.SERVER.IP/YOUR_ADMIN_PATH/api/health
# → {"status":"ok",...}
```

Open in browser: `https://YOUR.SERVER.IP/YOUR_ADMIN_PATH/`

---

## Ports reference

| Port | Protocol | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| 443 | TCP + UDP (HTTP/3) | HTTPS — Caddy (public) |
| 80 | TCP | ACME renewal only (not permanently open) |
| 8888 | TCP | Cascade UI — bound to 127.0.0.1, not public |
| 9351 | TCP | Optional native Prometheus endpoint — fixed path `/metrics`; protect with a token, VPN, or firewall |
| 51830 | UDP | WireGuard interface wg10 (first tunnel) |
| 51831 | UDP | WireGuard interface wg11, etc. |

WireGuard UDP ports must be open in the host firewall:

```bash
ufw allow 51830:51840/udp
```

---

## Data directory

All Cascade state is stored in `~/cascade/data/`:

```
data/
  wireguard.db          ← SQLite: interfaces, peers, routes, NAT, firewall rules, etc.
  *.save                ← ipset snapshots (auto-restored on startup)
  /etc/amnezia/amneziawg/wg10.conf   ← generated WireGuard configs (inside container)
```

The data directory is mounted into the container via `docker-compose.yml`.

---

## Updating

```bash
cd /opt/cascade
# Edit the exact image tag in docker-compose.yml first.
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8888/api/health
```

The image is pre-built by CI. Roll back by restoring the previous tag and applying
the same commands.

Caddy does not need to be restarted for Cascade updates.

> ⚠️ **Kernel module mode:** the Docker image tracks AmneziaWG's `:latest`
> protocol line, but the host's kernel module does not update itself. This
> mainly affects installs from **before the AmneziaWG 3.0 protocol jump
> (2026-07-30)** — the module stayed on the pre-3.0 line while the image
> moved to 3.0.x. If the two drift apart, interfaces fail to start with
> `Unable to modify interface: Invalid argument`. Re-sync the kernel module
> whenever you update the container in this mode:
> ```bash
> sudo bash deploy/switch-mode.sh --kernel
> ```
> Userspace mode is unaffected — it has no host kernel-module dependency.

---

## Clean Reinstall

Use this procedure when you need to wipe all Cascade state and start from scratch
(lost admin password, corrupted database, major configuration change, etc.).

> ⚠️ **This deletes all interfaces, peers, routes, NAT rules, and firewall rules.**
> Export any configs you need before proceeding.

### Step 1 — Stop and remove the container

```bash
cd ~/cascade
docker compose down
```

### Step 2 — Bring down WireGuard interfaces

Cascade runs with `--network host`, so WireGuard interfaces survive container removal.
Bring them down manually:

```bash
# List active WireGuard interfaces:
ip -d link show | grep -E "wg[0-9]+"

# Bring each one down (repeat for wg10, wg11, etc.):
awg-quick down wg10
# or for standard WireGuard:
wg-quick down wg10
```

If `awg-quick` / `wg-quick` are not available on the host, use `ip link`:

```bash
ip link delete wg10
```

### Step 3 — Remove all Cascade data

```bash
# SQLite database, ipset snapshots — all configuration:
rm -rf ~/cascade/data/

# WireGuard config files generated by Cascade:
rm -f /etc/amnezia/amneziawg/wg*.conf
rm -f /etc/wireguard/wg*.conf
```

### Step 4 — Flush leftover iptables rules (optional but recommended)

```bash
# Remove stale FORWARD / NAT / mangle rules from previous run:
iptables-nft -F FIREWALL_FORWARD 2>/dev/null || true
iptables-nft -X FIREWALL_FORWARD 2>/dev/null || true
iptables-nft -t mangle -F FIREWALL_MANGLE 2>/dev/null || true
iptables-nft -t mangle -X FIREWALL_MANGLE 2>/dev/null || true
iptables-nft -t nat -F POSTROUTING
```

> **Tip:** A server reboot achieves the same result without risk of affecting other services.

### Step 5 — Pull the configured release image and start

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

On first start with an empty `data/` directory, Cascade creates a fresh database.
Open the UI — you will be prompted to create the first admin account.

---

## Troubleshooting

### AmneziaWG module not loaded after reboot

```bash
modprobe amneziawg
# If that fails — check DKMS build status:
dkms status
uname -r        # must be 6.x
```

### Cascade container exits immediately

```bash
docker logs cascade
```

Common causes:
- invalid or missing runtime configuration; inspect the preceding log message

### Interfaces not appearing in UI

```bash
# Confirm API is reachable through Caddy:
curl -k https://YOUR.SERVER.IP/YOUR_ADMIN_PATH/api/health

# Check Cascade logs:
docker logs cascade | tail -30
```

If the UI loads but the Interfaces page is empty — make sure you are accessing
the UI via `https://YOUR.SERVER.IP/YOUR_ADMIN_PATH/` (with trailing slash).
Without the trailing slash, relative API paths resolve incorrectly.

### Caddy certificate errors

```bash
# Re-issue the certificate:
~/.acme.sh/acme.sh --issue --server letsencrypt -d YOUR.SERVER.IP \
  --standalone --certificate-profile shortlived --force

# Reinstall:
~/.acme.sh/acme.sh --install-cert -d YOUR.SERVER.IP \
  --key-file /etc/ssl/cascade/server.key \
  --fullchain-file /etc/ssl/cascade/server.crt \
  --reloadcmd "docker exec cascade-caddy caddy reload --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile 2>/dev/null || true"

# Restart Caddy:
cd ~/cascade/deploy/caddy && docker compose restart
```

### WireGuard tunnel not passing traffic

```bash
# Check interface is up:
ip -d link show wg10

# Check NAT rule exists:
iptables-nft -t nat -L POSTROUTING -n -v | grep MASQUERADE

# Check IP forwarding:
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward    # must be 1

# If PostUp rules are missing — Stop and Start the interface in the UI
```

### QUIC UDP buffer warning in Caddy logs

```
failed to sufficiently increase receive buffer size (was: 208 kiB, wanted: 7168 kiB, got: 416 kiB)
```

This is a warning, not an error. HTTP/3 works but with a smaller buffer.
To silence it, apply the sysctl settings from Step 4 and restart Caddy.

### Disk filling up over time

On small VPS disks (e.g. 10 GB), repeated manual `./scripts/build.sh` runs and normal
container operation can accumulate disk usage outside of anything Cascade
itself stores. Check where the space actually went before deleting anything:

```bash
df -h /
du -xh --max-depth=1 / 2>/dev/null | sort -rh | head -20
```

Then drill into whichever top-level directory is largest
(`du -xh --max-depth=1 /usr`, `/var`, etc.) until you find the actual offender.
Common culprits, safest-first:

**1. Docker build cache** — grows with every manual `docker build`/`./scripts/build.sh`
run; a `--filter "until=..."` prune often leaves cache entries marked
`shared: true` behind. Confirm with `docker system df -v` (look at "Build
cache usage"), then clear it fully — this never touches running containers or
volumes, only cached intermediate build layers, so the next build is just
slower (no cache), not lossy:

```bash
docker system df -v
docker builder prune -a -f
```

**2. Unused images** — left behind after moving the Compose file to a new release tag:

```bash
docker image prune -f
```

**3. Docker container logs** — the `cascade` service has no log size limit by
default (`json-file` driver), so long-running installs can accumulate a large
log file:

```bash
docker inspect --format='{{.LogPath}}' cascade | xargs du -h
# safe to truncate live, without touching the running container:
truncate -s 0 $(docker inspect --format='{{.LogPath}}' cascade)
```

**4. systemd journal / apt cache** — not Cascade-related, but common on small
VPS images:

```bash
journalctl --vacuum-size=200M
apt-get clean
```

**5. Old kernel packages** — `setup.sh` upgrades Ubuntu 22.04 to the HWE 6.x
kernel; leftover previous kernel versions in `/usr/lib/modules` and
`/usr/src` add up. Confirm the currently **running** kernel first
(`uname -r`), then remove only the others via `apt-get autoremove` — never
remove the kernel that's currently booted.

**6. Old `pre-restore-*.tar.gz` backups** — created automatically before every
restore-from-backup operation, in `/etc/wireguard/data/`; there's currently no
automatic pruning, so old ones accumulate if you restore from backup
repeatedly:

```bash
ls -lh /etc/wireguard/data/pre-restore-*.tar.gz
rm /etc/wireguard/data/pre-restore-<old-timestamp>.tar.gz
```

---

## acme.sh auto-renewal

acme.sh installs a cron job automatically during installation. Verify:

```bash
crontab -l | grep acme
# expected: something like: 0 0 * * * /root/.acme.sh/acme.sh --cron --home /root/.acme.sh ...
```

On renewal, acme.sh runs the `--reloadcmd` configured in Step 9,
which reloads Caddy config without downtime.
