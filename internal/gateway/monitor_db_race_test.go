// Regression test: globalThresholds() (called from probeICMP/probeHTTP,
// themselves run from a goroutine that Monitor.Start fires immediately and
// asynchronously) used to panic instead of falling back to defaults when the
// database wasn't initialized — because settings.GetSettings() calls
// db.DB(), which panics on a nil instance, defeating this function's own
// documented "falls back to hardcoded defaults on error" contract. This is a
// real race in production too (a probe fired right at process shutdown,
// after db.Close()), but was only actually observed via a unit test: a
// gateway created with Monitor:true fires its first probe synchronously
// inside a newly spawned goroutine, which can still be mid-flight — reaching
// this exact code path — after the test that created it returns and its
// t.Cleanup closes the test database, panicking the whole test binary
// (confirmed in CI; not reproducible locally, since this sandbox's
// util.Exec no-ops non-Linux commands, changing the timing enough to avoid
// the race in practice).
